### Tech Events

## About the project
Tech Events is part of one of the Factoria F5 Bootcamp projects. The main goals of it are :

Tech Events is a web application where the users can explore and subscribe between different technology events. The aim of this project is to promote masterclasses, workshops and webinars to those interested in web programming, gaming and state-of-the-art techologies.    

## How to use

If you want to see our project you should first clone this repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/ginkgob/techEvents.git`. It is recommended to install the last version of [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html) and [laravel](https://laravel.com/). Once installed, execute a local server in your code editor typing `$ php artisan serve` in your terminal. It is important to name DB_DATABASE in your `.env` folder with the same name as your new table in your local database.  

- Implement the rights depending if you are a  Guest, Admin or User.

- Understand the Laravel's logic.

- Use a framework (in our case, we choose Tailwind)


## What is Tech Events about?
Tech events is a web page where you can see different technological events, whether they are masterclasses, workshops or webinars.

You will be able to see the past events, the highlighted ones and the ones that are still available. If you are interested in one of the events, you can (by clicking on it) see more details about it, and if you wish, you can sign up for the event.

If you have missclicked, and you joined an event you didn't want to, don't worry! you will be able to unsubscribe without any problem. 

In addition, you will be able to see how many people have signed up for the event and the number of maximum places it has.

Furthermore, as a registered user, you will be able to access your profile and modify your data such as email, name and profile picture. And you will also have a page where you can see the events you have signed up for!

As an admin, you will be able to create, view, modify, delete and highlight events. Those that are marked as highlighted, will go directly to the landing page, and those events that have already ended, will be removed from the available events and will go directly to the "past events" page.
